For long-haired breeds like Maine Coons or Persians, you'll need:\n\n1.  **A wide-toothed comb:** For gently working out large tangles.\n2.  **A slicker brush:** For removing loose undercoat and preventing mats.\n3.  **A soft bristle brush:** For finishing and adding shine.\n\n### The Process\n\nStart slow and make it a positive experience. Use treats and praise. Brush in the direction of hair growth and be extra gentle around the belly and legs.",
